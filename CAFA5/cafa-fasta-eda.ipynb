The train sequences are significantly longer than the test sequences.\n2. There is no significant difference in the amino acid compositions between the train and test sequences\n\n## Next steps: \n1. Explore GO Terms and Taxonomy data\n2. Analyze embeddings \n3. Start modeling strategy\n\nCredit to Simon Veitner for some of the figures: https://www.kaggle.com/code/simonveitner/basic-eda-of-sequences\n\n## What is a FASTA file?\n\nA FASTA file is a simple and commonly used file format in bioinformatics for storing biological sequence data, such as DNA or protein sequences. It's like a text document that organizes genetic information in a specific way.\n\nImagine you have a long, complex code that represents a sequence of DNA or protein molecules. It's like a secret message that only scientists can understand. The FASTA file provides a standardized way to write down and share  a sequence of residues with other researchers.\n\nIn a FASTA file, each sequence starts with a unique identifier, which is like a name or label for that particular sequence. It helps scientists keep track of different sequences they are working with. After the identifier, you have the actual genetic code represented by letters: A, C, G, and T for DNA sequences, or letters representing different amino acids for protein sequences.\n\nTo make it more readable, the code is often split into lines of a certain length, called line wrapping. This helps scientists visually process the information and ensures that the file doesn't become too wide or difficult to work with.\n\nSo, in simpler terms, a FASTA file is like a special document that stores genetic information. It's a way for scientists to share and organize sequences of DNA or proteins, making it easier for them to study and understand the building blocks of life.\n\nWe'll use Biopython.SeqIO to work with the FASTA files.","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-23T19:00:50.883531Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-23T19:00:50.883917Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-23T19:00:50.897651Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-23T19:00:50.883888Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-23T19:00:50.89591Z"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# we will use bio python to read the sequences\nfrom Bio import SeqIO\n# numpy to work with arrays\nimport numpy as np\n# plotly to plot the graphs\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n# Counter to count stuff\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy import stats\nimport re","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-26T19:39:37.624611Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-26T19:39:37.625007Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-26T19:39:38.136159Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-26T19:39:37.624976Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-26T19:39:38.134939Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Think of Bio.SeqIO as a toolbox that provides various tools to handle biological sequences, such as DNA, RNA, or protein sequences.

In this case, the U statistic is 10900212030.5, which represents the sum of the ranks of the values in the smaller sample (train_lengths) when combined with the ranks of the values in the larger sample (test_lengths).\n\np-value: The p-value is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis. In this case, the p-value is approximately 7.60e-301, which is extremely close to zero. This suggests strong evidence against the null hypothesis and indicates a significant difference between the sequence length distributions of the train and test datasets.\n\nThis corroborates the KS test results.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Sequence Composition Analysis","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Frequency of each residue","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Parse the train and test FASTA files\ntrain_sequences = SeqIO.parse(train_fasta, \"fasta\")\ntest_sequences = SeqIO.parse(test_fasta, \"fasta\")\n\n# Calculate the frequency of each amino acid in train sequences\ntrain_frequency = Counter()\nfor record in train_sequences:\n    sequence = str(record.seq)\n    train_frequency.update(sequence)\n\n# Calculate the frequency of each amino acid in test sequences\ntest_frequency = Counter()\nfor record in test_sequences:\n    sequence = str(record.seq)\n    test_frequency.update(sequence)\n\n# Print the frequency of each amino acid in train sequences\nprint(\"Frequency of amino acids in train sequences:\")\nfor item in train_frequency.most_common():\n    print(item[0], \":\", item[1])\n\n# Print the frequency of each amino acid in test sequences\nprint(\"\\nFrequency of amino acids in test sequences:\")\nfor item in test_frequency.most_common():\n    print(item[0], \":\", item[1])","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-26T19:28:11.850486Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-26T19:28:11.851271Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-26T19:28:21.725585Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-26T19:28:11.851235Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-26T19:28:21.723954Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Frequencies of amino acids in train sequences\ntrain_freq = {\n    'L': 7386109, 'S': 6493284, 'A': 5601393, 'E': 5388873, 'G': 5061691,\n    'V': 4931367, 'K': 4594229, 'P': 4382337, 'T': 4378528, 'R': 4283020,\n    'D': 4151113, 'I': 3879567, 'Q': 3563728, 'N': 3400751, 'F': 2930638,\n    'Y': 2239153, 'H': 1914456, 'M': 1776672, 'C': 1504314, 'W': 888449,\n    'X': 2771, 'U': 148, 'O': 4, 'B': 4, 'Z': 4\n}\n\n# Frequencies of amino acids in test sequences\ntest_freq = {\n    'L': 6571441, 'S': 5512318, 'A': 4750271, 'E': 4588833, 'G': 4318376,\n    'V': 4223179, 'K': 4060313, 'T': 3650414, 'P': 3648374, 'R': 3611308,\n    'I': 3501751, 'D': 3501462, 'Q': 2950714, 'N': 2919742, 'F': 2667898,\n    'Y': 1970413, 'H': 1628870, 'M': 1545971, 'C': 1264828, 'W': 798942,\n    'X': 657, 'U': 218, 'Z': 45, 'B': 39\n}\n\n# Determine all unique amino acids\nall_amino_acids = list(set(list(train_freq.keys()) + list(test_freq.keys())))\n\n# Add zero frequencies for missing amino acids\nfor aa in all_amino_acids:\n    if aa not in train_freq:\n        train_freq[aa] = 0\n    if aa not in test_freq:\n        test_freq[aa] = 0\n\n# Calculate relative frequencies by dividing by the total number of sequences\ntrain_total = sum(train_freq.values())\ntest_total = sum(test_freq.values())\n\ntrain_relative_freq = {aa: freq / train_total for aa, freq in train_freq.items()}\ntest_relative_freq = {aa: freq / test_total for aa, freq in test_freq.items()}\n\n# Visualize the distributions using bar plots\nlabels = train_relative_freq.keys()\nx = np.arange(len(labels))\nwidth = 0.35\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nrects1 = ax.bar(x -
