# Data-Science-Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This portfolio showcases some of my projects and work related to data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Each project includes a brief description, the data used, and the techniques and tools applied.

#Projects

Project 1: Stroke Occurrence Prediction
https://github.com/bschulman/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/5c7ac37f1a63750cf2a7efae8a04b96d4aa04e2e/Kaggle_stroke.ipynb
Description: Build a classification model using neural networks to predict the probability of positive stroke
Data: The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Stroke Prediction Dataset. 
Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original.
