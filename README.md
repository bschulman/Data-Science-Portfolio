# Data-Science-Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This portfolio showcases some of my projects and work related to data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Each project includes a brief description, the data used, and the techniques and tools applied.

# **Projects**

## Project 1 
#### Kaggle Playground Series Season 3, Episode 2: Tabular Classification with a Stroke Prediction Dataset
[(Stroke Occurrence Prediction)](https://github.com/bschulman/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/5c7ac37f1a63750cf2a7efae8a04b96d4aa04e2e/Kaggle_stroke.ipynb)

### Description: 
Build a classification model using neural networks to predict the probability of a stroke based on demographic data

### Data: 
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e2/data ) for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Stroke Prediction Dataset. 
Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original.

### Techniques and Tools: 

Python, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, Feedforward Neural Networks


## Project 2
* Work in progress
#### Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
[(Titanic Survival Prediction)](https://github.com/bschulman/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/ed1b426d0a8ae8aae0fa48a8a4883e3e886a4766/Kaggle%20Titanic%20-%20Machine%20Learning%20from%20Disaster.ipynb)

### Description: 
Build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using the passenger data (i.e., name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.).

### Data: 
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data ) for this competition includes passenger information like name, age, gender, and socio-economic class. 

### Techniques and Tools: 

Python, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Ensemble Techniques, Support Vector Machines


## Project 3 
*Work in progress*
#### Tabular Playground Series - Jul 2022
[(Kaggle's first ever unsupervised clustering challenge)](https://github.com/bschulman/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Clustering)

### Description: 
In this challenge, you are given a dataset where each row belongs to a particular cluster. Your job is to predict the cluster each row belongs to. You are not given any training data, and you are not told how many clusters are found in the ground truth labels.

### Data: 
For this challenge, you are given (simulated) manufacturing control [data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tabular-playground-series-jul-2022/data) that can be clustered into different control states. Your task is to cluster the data into these control states. You are not given any training data, and you are not told how many possible control states there are. This is a completely unsupervised problem, one you might encounter in a real-world setting.
### Techniques and Tools: 

Python, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, Clustering: K-means and GMM, Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, Autoencoder
