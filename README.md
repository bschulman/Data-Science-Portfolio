# Data-Science-Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This portfolio showcases some of my projects and work related to data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Each project includes a brief description, the data used, and the techniques and tools applied.

# **Projects**

## Project 1 
#### Kaggle Playground Series Season 3, Episode 2: Tabular Classification with a Stroke Prediction Dataset
[(Stroke Occurrence Prediction)](https://github.com/bschulman/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/5c7ac37f1a63750cf2a7efae8a04b96d4aa04e2e/Kaggle_stroke.ipynb)

### Description: 
Build a classification model using neural networks to predict the probability of a stroke based on demographic data

### Data: 
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e2/data ) for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Stroke Prediction Dataset. 
Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original.



### Techniques and Tools: 

Python, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, tensorflow, Keras, Feedforward Neural Networks

*More to come!*
